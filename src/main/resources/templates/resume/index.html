        <h2 class="text-left">Resume Builder Tips</h2>
        <div class="student-div">
            <p>
                During your time at Codeup, you will build at least 2 different types of resumes, a “T-Block” and a
                “Vertical". Today, we are going to go over the T-Block resume. The purpose of the T-Block resume is to
                have
                a 1 page, easy to consume resume. Your resume will be made up of 5-6 different sections listed below in
                order of importance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Professional Summary</li>
                <li>Technical Skills</li>
                <li>Development Projects</li>
                <li>Professional Experience</li>
                <li>Military Experience (if warranted)</li>
                <li>Education</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-left">Professional Summary</h3>

        <p>A hiring manager will spend 5-7 seconds on a resume before they move on. This is where you get their
            attention.
            Each summary should be made up of 2-3 sentences where you will:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bring out your good qualities</li>
            <li>Mention why you decided to become a Software Developer</li>
            <li>Why does this matter to a company</li>
            <li>*If you get stuck trying to write your summary: ask loved ones what it is they love and respect about
                you.
                Take the characteristics they point out and infuse it into your summary. 
                Here are a few examples:
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love the way technology requires us to learn, relearn, unlearn, and create the most optimal solutions for
            everyday
            business needs. Ideas poised for generating real value in our communities are conceptualized every day, and
            I’m
            passionate about making these visions a reality using my skills as a software developer.</p>

        <p>Highly creative maker with a love for designing and building things for others to use. Excellent
            interpersonal
            skills and a strong background in working collaboratively to solve complicated problems and tackle extensive
            projects. Seeking to become a developer at a firm that values diversity, growing its team members, and
            giving
            back
            to the community.</p>

        <p>As a software developer, I thrive most in the ever-changing technology enhancements by constantly performing
            research and learning something new. I am versatile and a quick learner willing to embrace new challenges
            and
            eager
            to learn more and grow as a software engineer. I will strive to be a supportive and enthusiastic team player
            dedicated to streamlining processes and efficiently resolving project issues.</p>

        <p>I am an innately inquisitive and purpose-driven developer with a fascination for creating useful products. As
            a
            former chef, I have cultivated strong problem-solving skills, and I know what it takes to thrive in a team
            environment with customer satisfaction as a primary goal. I look forward to imparting these skills along
            with my
            thirst to learn into being an effective programmer. It is my desire to join a team that fosters personal and
            professional growth.</p>

        <p>I love the dynamic tools software development gives me to tackle ideas and problems I pursue and encounter.
            Programming is an exciting and engaging way to contribute to the digital machinery that is the cornerstone
            of
            our
            modern world. It’s a constantly evolving field that always challenges me to learn and in return gives me
            great
            flexibility to leverage my skills to solve problems and innovate.</p>

        <h3 class="text-left">Contact Information</h3>
        <p>(not a section heading > succinctly across the top of the resume)</p>

        <p>Include the following contact information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phone number (in this format > XXX-XXX-XXXX)</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>LinkedIn Profile URL</li>
            <li>GitHub URL</li>
            <li>Personal website (once approved)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-left">Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>This is where you list the Technical skills that you developed during your time here at Codeup. It’s very
            important
            that you only list Technical Skills that you can answer 3 levels deep in difficulty. Please list the
            following
            skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            JavaScript
            BootStrap
            VCS with Git
            Paired Programming
            Thymeleaf
            Test-Driven Development
            Java SE
            MySQL
            Spring Boot Framework
            jQuery
            Object-Oriented Programming
            Java EE (Servlets, JSP)
        </ul>

        <p>If you’ve developed any additional skills but you’re not comfortable with an answer 3 levels deep in
            difficulty,
            you
            may add a section called “Exposure to” and list those skills there.</p>

        <h3 class="text-left">Development Projects</h3>
        <p>It’s important to not only have technical knowledge but also technical projects. During your time at Codeup,
            you
            will build 4-5 projects that you will be listed here. IF you have the additional time to create your own
            projects,
            you are encouraged to add them instead of some of the earlier projects. The format of the descriptions
            should
            be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Give a summary of what the project was about.</li>
            <li>What your role was and what languages were used to create the project.</li>
            <li>List the projects in order, starting with the most recent.</li>
        </ul>
        Professional Experience
        While you may or may not have any technical background, we still want to feature your professional background
        and
        those skills that you had that transferred over to making you a better Software Developer. Give a Summary of
        your
        responsibilities, ideally those relevant to the job you're looking for. See example of resumes for proper
        format.

        <h3 class="text-left">Military Experience (if applicable)</h3>
        <p>List your Military background as far as what Branch, years served and duties. Please include any active or
            past
            clearance.</p>

        <h3 class="text-left">Education</h3>
        <p>For Codeup, add the following:</p>

        <p>A fully-immersive, project-based, and intensive 20-week full-stack Java career accelerator that provides
            students
            with 670+ hours of expert instruction in software development.</p>

        <p>This is a great place to list any further education that you have, not including a high school diploma. This
            doesn’t
            have to be restricted to technical degrees.</p>
